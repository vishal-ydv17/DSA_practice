## Quick Overview
- **Problem Type**: Array, Greedy  
- **Difficulty**: Easy  
- **Key Concept**: Greedy parsing of bits  
- **Solution Summary**:  
  Traverse the bits from left to right:  
  - If current bit is `1`, skip the next bit (since it forms a 2-bit char),  
  - If current bit is `0`, move normally.  
  Finally, check if the last interpreted character is `0`.
