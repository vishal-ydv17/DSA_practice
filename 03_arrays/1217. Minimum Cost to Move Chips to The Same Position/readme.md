## Quick Overview
- **Problem Type**: Greedy  
- **Difficulty**: Easy  
- **Key Concept**: Parity of positions  
- **Solution Summary**:  
  Moving a chip by 2 positions costs `0`, and by 1 position costs `1`.  
  So group chips by parity (even/odd) and return the **min count** between the two groups.
