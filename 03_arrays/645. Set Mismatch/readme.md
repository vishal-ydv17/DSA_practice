## Quick Overview  
- **Problem Type:** Array, Hashing  
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Key Concept:** Find the duplicate and missing number using sum / set or counting  
- **Solution:**  
  1. Traverse the array once, track numbers seen (e.g., using a set)  
  2. While iterating, if you encounter a number already in the set, that’s the **duplicate**  
  3. Also compute the expected sum of numbers from 1 to _n_ and subtract the actual sum to find the **missing** number (or use sum of set to help)  
  4. Return both as `[duplicate, missing]`
