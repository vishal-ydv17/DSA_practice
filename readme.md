## 🧠 Daily DSA Grind  

- 💻 I solve **at least one DSA problem every day** — first on **VS Code**, then push it to my **GitHub repository**.  
- 🔍 After that, I solve the same problem on **LeetCode**, where I document:  
  -  The **intuition** behind my approach  
  -  The **logic** and step-by-step **solution flow**  
  -  The **optimized code** with time & space complexity analysis  
- 🚀 Goal: To strengthen problem-solving, pattern recognition, and analytical skills through **daily consistency**.  
- 🕒 Current streak: 300+ *(updating daily)*  
- 📝 Check out all my solutions and detailed explanations here:
